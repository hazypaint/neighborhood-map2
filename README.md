Neighborhood map of the Basel area in Switzerland.

This is a single-page application featuring a map of the Basel area in Switzerland. Additional functionality includes: map markers to identify locations of interest, a search function to easily discover these locations, and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations. As a third-party API I am using the Wikipedia API, which provides additional information about each of the locations.
